# SupplyChainManagement-Smart-Contract

This smart contract is a basic implementatino of supply chain management system. The contract is implemented in Solidity.This contract defines a struct to store product information, a mapping to store the information for each product, and a function to add new products to the supply chain.

## Getting Started

To use this smart contract, you will need a platform that supports smart contract deployment and execution, such as Ethereum. You will also need a tool such as Remix or Truffle to deploy and test the contract.

## Features

- Product Tracking: The smart contract allows for tracking of each product in the supply chain, from its origin to its final destination.
- Increased Accountability: The smart contract provides a clear and transparent record of all transactions, making it easier to hold participants accountable for their actions.
- Enhanced Security: The decentralized nature of blockchain technology enhances the security of the supply chain, making it more difficult for malicious actors to interfere with the flow of goods.
- Security: The smart contract is secured by the decentralized nature of blockchain technology, providing a secure platform for room reservations and payment processing.
- Transparency: All transactions and changes in the smart contract are recorded on the blockchain, providing a transparent and auditable record.

## Contract Methods

### `becomeManufacturer()`
his method allows an address to become a manufacturer by staking 10 ether.
### `addProduct()`
This method allows a manufacturer to add a product to the supply chain.
### `buyProduct()`
This method allows an address to buy a product from the supply chain by paying the correct price.
### `withdrawRevenue()`
This method allows the owner of the contract to withdraw the revenue earned from maintaining and verifying the details of the manufacturers.
